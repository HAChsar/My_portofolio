    <h1><strong><em>| EDUCATION</em></strong></h1>
    <p>I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, graduating with an impressive CGPA of 8.61. Prior to this, I completed my Intermediate education in the MPC stream, where I excelled with a CGPA of 9.59. My academic journey reflects a consistent dedication to 
        learning and excellence, particularly in fields that demand analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p> 
    <p>Currently, I am focused on Java full stack development and am working on a team project at Tata Strive as part of my training. This experience has further
         enhanced my understanding of software development and my ability to work collaboratively in a team environment.</p>
    <p>During my undergraduate studies, I took on various projects that honed my technical skills and deepened my understanding of complex engineering concepts. One such notable project involved designing and implementing a microcontroller-based automation system,
         which greatly enhanced my proficiency in embedded systems and programming languages such as C and Python.</p>
